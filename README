Version 2 of the TSClient LEGACY Package Manager (TPM)

Version two of the package manager for the TSClient LEGACY ThinClient operating
system is entirely written in C++. It uses GNU Tar, zlib, TinyXML2 and SQLite as
package database. It is designated to be more extendible and faster than version
1, which was entirey written in OCaml. This must be the last package manager,
there won't be enough time for another one.
