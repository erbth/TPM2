Version 2 of the TSClient LEGACY Package Manager (TPM)

Version two of the package manager for the TSClient LEGACY ThinClient operating
system is entirely written in C++. It uses GNU Tar, zlib, TinyXML2, SQLite as
package database, and OpenSSL to sign repository indexes with RSA keys. It is
designated to be more extendible and faster than version 1, which was entirey
written in OCaml.  This must be the last package manager, there won't be enough
time for another one.
